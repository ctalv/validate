This will start as open source file validator through file signatures for Python. The current stretch goals (in order) will be:
1. To have a content disarm and reconstruction software
2. To have thourough documentation
3. To be available as a python package
4. To be avalaible as a node package
5. Probably more!
This is meant to offer something that is very accessible to those who are looking to allow user file input but may not have the time or resources to create a robust file validator.
